# FP4-proposal

The project proposal includes these components:

1. A repository for the team project
2. A `README.md` file in this repository, which is the project plan
3. A 3-slide slide deck to be presented in class

## Due Dates
* Wed 2016-04-06 at 12 noon (before class) (Martin section)
* Thu 2016-04-07 at 3:30p (before class) (Sherman section)

Ask questions, as always, [on our discussion forum!][forum]

## Instructions

Teams will submit a single proposal, with sections that each member has done individually detailing their proposed contributions. The submission will be the `README.md` file in your brand-new project repository, which you'll make. 

You must start using GitHub collaboratively from this point forward. 

Instructions: 

1. Create a new repo as part of the `oplS16projects` organization
  * Give it a name that you like—may be your real names, usernames, or project name
  * Add your teammates as collaborators (Settings > Collaborators & Teams > Add Collaborator)
2. Copy the content from the [template file](template.md) into your `README.md`
  * Click the “Raw” button on the `template.md` file and then copy-paste into your repo's `README.md` edit view
  * Save it
  * Then start editing it to be the real thing
3. Everyone on the team contributes their sections to your `README.md` file.
  * Use GitHub's collaboration features to make sure that each team member contributes meaningful content to the file
  * At the absolute minimum, respective team members must have commits that show they have authored the section describing their planned contributions
4. Create a [github Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/
) of your repository. 
 * Version: v0.0
 * Title: Proposal
 * Description: tag `@fgmart` or `@marksherman` depending on your section

And now some detail on what to write _in_ the report.

**Overall guidance:** *You should be proposing something that you have high confidence that you can achieve, and the proposal should project that confidence.*

The proposal should be no longer than necessary, but long enough to include critical detail. Diagrams are welcome. 

Remember, you can do some neat [formatting things with Markdown.][markdown]

In case you missed it, here again is the [template file](template.md)

## In-Class Presentation 
Teams will each deliver an in-class presentation. Your team will have two minutes to present.

The presentation shall have exactly three slides:

1. Title
  * project title (10 words or fewer)
  * your real names
  * each real name followed by GitHub username
  * a relevant image of some sort (optional)
2. Overview
  * a few short phrases describing the project
  * a different relevant image (optional)
3. Architecture Diagram 
  * visual diagram showing the major components of the project
  * include external things that your project will connect to
  * include arrows showing flow of information
  * internal components annotated with Racket libraries that they will use
  * _important:_ annotate each block with the GH username of the person who is primarily responsible for its creation

Make the slides in [Google Slides][gslides].

Then, import your deck into the correct whole-class slide deck:
* [Martin section][martinslides]
* [Sherman section][shermanslides]

You and your teammates will give the presentation in class the day that this assignment is due.

## Grading
The proposal must be submitted on time to receive credit. Late submissions will not be accepted for credit.

You personally must be present in class (and participate in the presentation when it is your turn) to receive credit for the presentation. If your teammates are there and you are not, they will receive presentation credit and you will not.
